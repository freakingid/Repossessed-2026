# STATUS — Repossessed

**Last updated:** 2026-07-05 (conversational session — spec + doc setup)
**State in one line:** Greenfield. No game code yet. GDD v1.1 and the level
loader+generator spec are complete and signed off. Ready for the first
implementation session (subsystem #1: level loader + generator).

## How to use this file

Claude Code reads this **first**, every session, before touching code. At the
**end** of every session, update *Build status* and append to the *Decision log*
and *Architecture decisions* sections. This is the cross-session memory — keep it
current or the next session starts blind.

## Build status (mirrors GDD build-status index — all NOT BUILT)

- [ ] **§8 Level** — loader + generator, tile set, dark lighting, Night escalation   ← **NEXT**
- [ ] §2 Player — movement, health/overheal, melee, ranged, carry/vault states
- [ ] §7 Interactive objects — crates, barrels, shrapnel, carry physics
- [ ] §6.4 Pathfinding — grid A\*, per-class masks, nav-dirtying
- [ ] §6 Enemies + spawners
- [ ] §5 Abilities — Nova, Lightning, gem economy
- [ ] §3 Power-ups & pickups
- [ ] §12 Meta — menu, pause, options, 5-slot save/load, achievements, high score
- [ ] §9/§10/§11 Scoring, HUD, render/lighting, audio

Repo currently contains: `LICENSE` only.

## Implementation sequencing (agreed order)

1. **Level Definition loader + generator**  — `SPEC-LEVEL.md`  ← current
2. Player + carry system
3. Pathfinding infrastructure
4. Enemies + spawners
5. Abilities
6. Meta systems
7. Rendering / lighting

Later subsystems leave **seams** in earlier ones (SPEC-LEVEL §6): nav-blocker
registry (#3), plate-press / key-spend setters (#2), spawner tick (#4),
light-emitter registry (#7), music registry. Fill seams, don't reach across.

## Documentation index (authoritative sources)

- `GDD.md` — design intent (v1.1, complete).
- `CLAUDE.md` — conventions + non-negotiables (loaded every session).
- `SPEC-LEVEL.md` — level loader+generator implementation spec (final, signed off).
- `STATUS.md` — this file.
- `add2026` repo — **external, read-only** reference only (GDD §13); never a
  Repossessed source of truth, never committed to.

## Decision log (append-only)

### 2026-07-05 — SPEC-LEVEL signed off (D1–D3, Q3)
- **D1 — grid field is `tiles`** (array of row-major strings), not `grid`.
  Matches ADD's loader/validator/world primitives. (SPEC-LEVEL §1)
- **D2 — `generateLevel(n, rng)` takes an injected rng.** Content
  (roster / spawn budget / ramp) is a **pure function of `n`**; geometry and
  placement consume the rng — **fresh** seed in production (layout varies per
  visit), **fixed** seed in tests. **No seed is persisted** in saves; resume
  rebuilds a fresh layout with the same n-derived content. (SPEC-LEVEL §1, §5; GDD §12.3)
- **D3 — doors/plates are one model.** Grid char (`d` plate-door, `_` plate,
  `D` locked) places the cell; a `placement` assigns its `id`; `links` wire
  plate→door. Locked `D` doors are pure tiles (key-driven, no id/link).
  (SPEC-LEVEL §1, §3)
- **Q3 — "no two consecutive dark Nights"** tracked via one **unsaved** boolean
  `G._prevDark` (starts `false` on resume; harmless). (SPEC-LEVEL §9)
- **Convention — recommended code split:** implement subsystem #1 as
  `level-loader.js` + `level-generator.js` (SPEC-LEVEL §7), per split-on-seams
  file discipline.

## Architecture / circular-import decisions

### 2026-07-05 — `world` ↔ `level-loader` (register-callbacks)
`world.js` exposes `registerTileStateResolver(fn)`. `level-loader.js` (Phase 3)
will register itself as the resolver at load time; `world.js` never imports
`level-loader.js`. `isWall`/`blocksLOS` consult the resolver first for every
cell (not just `d`/`D`) and fall back to the static `CFG.TILES` flag when no
resolver is registered or the resolver returns a falsy state — this is the
correct behavior since the resolver stub only ever returns a truthy state for
actual door cells. Matches SPEC-LEVEL §7's flagged risk, resolved as
prescribed.

*(Still expected later: `level` ↔ `nav` and `level` ↔ entity factories, both
via register-callbacks / one-way flow — see SPEC-LEVEL §7.)*

## Known open items (non-blocking for build)

Tuning / design-feel only — none block implementing the mechanism:
Q1 archetype algorithm play-feel; Q2 key budget (GDD §14.1); Q4 fallback
archetype identity; Q5 the `(proposed)` generator numbers (GDD §14.2).

## Session log

### 2026-07-05 — Phase 1 (config/state foundation)

Phase 1 — config/state/package.json authored; CFG.{TILES,PLAN,RAMP,SPAWNER,GEN}
in place; G run-state + G.ramp slot + G._prevDark added. `node test-config.js`
green (11 checks). `config.js`/`state.js` import nothing (leaf modules,
confirmed structurally by the test). No behavior/build-status box flipped —
data only.

**Spec gap found (not invented around):** SPEC-LEVEL §5.1's `CFG.PLAN.costs`
table omits `lobber`, despite `lobber` being introduced as a roster element on
Night 4 (§5.1 `introductions`). Filled in using the same documented formula
the rest of the table follows (GDD §6.2 pts ÷ 50): Lobber = 100 pts → cost 2
(matches Skeleton's cost, which also has 100 pts). Comment left in
`config.js` at the `costs` table. Flagging here per CLAUDE.md's "surface,
don't invent design" rule — this is a mechanical fill via an existing
formula, not a new tuning decision, but worth a sign-off glance.

### 2026-07-05 — Phase 2 (`world.js` — tile-grid primitives)

Ported from add2026 `src/world.js`: `loadTileGrid`, `isWall`, `blocksLOS`,
`tileCenter`, `randomFloorTileTC`, `randomFloorTile`, `tileFloor`,
`bodyHitsWall`, `hasLineOfSight`. Added `registerTileStateResolver` seam
(§3.2) — see *Architecture / circular-import decisions* above. Deleted (not
stubbed): `bakeConveyors`, `isDestructible`, `destroyShelf`, `pushField`/
`pushAt`/`pushAtWorld`/`applyBeltPush`/`clampNet` (all conveyor-only), and the
Cleaner-patrol-only helpers not required by this phase's spec list
(`tileClearRun`, `rectPerimeterClear`, `isBorderTile`, `moveBody`, `clamp`) —
none were named in SPEC-LEVEL §3.1's reuse list; add back if a later phase's
spec calls for them. `node test-world.js` green (28 checks), `node
test-config.js` still green (11 checks). No import of `level-loader.js` from
`world.js` (grep-verified).

**Spec gap found (not invented around):** `CFG.TILE` (tile pixel size) was
missing from Phase 1's `config.js` — every geometry helper ported in this
phase (`bodyHitsWall`, `tileCenter`, `hasLineOfSight`, `randomFloorTile`)
needs it. Not specified in SPEC-LEVEL or GDD excerpts read this session.
Ported verbatim from add2026 `CFG.TILE: 32` (a fixed pixel constant, not a
design decision) into `config.js`, commented at the point of addition.
Flagging per CLAUDE.md's "surface, don't invent design" rule — this is a
mechanical port of an existing constant, not new tuning, but worth a
sign-off glance in case Repossessed wants a different tile size.

Code map: `src/world.js` now exists.
