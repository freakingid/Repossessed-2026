# STATUS — Repossessed

**Last updated:** 2026-07-05 (conversational session — spec + doc setup)
**State in one line:** Greenfield. No game code yet. GDD v1.1 and the level
loader+generator spec are complete and signed off. Ready for the first
implementation session (subsystem #1: level loader + generator).

## How to use this file

Claude Code reads this **first**, every session, before touching code. At the
**end** of every session, update *Build status* and append to the *Decision log*
and *Architecture decisions* sections. This is the cross-session memory — keep it
current or the next session starts blind.

## Build status (mirrors GDD build-status index — all NOT BUILT)

- [ ] **§8 Level** — loader + generator, tile set, dark lighting, Night escalation   ← **NEXT**
- [ ] §2 Player — movement, health/overheal, melee, ranged, carry/vault states
- [ ] §7 Interactive objects — crates, barrels, shrapnel, carry physics
- [ ] §6.4 Pathfinding — grid A\*, per-class masks, nav-dirtying
- [ ] §6 Enemies + spawners
- [ ] §5 Abilities — Nova, Lightning, gem economy
- [ ] §3 Power-ups & pickups
- [ ] §12 Meta — menu, pause, options, 5-slot save/load, achievements, high score
- [ ] §9/§10/§11 Scoring, HUD, render/lighting, audio

Repo currently contains: `LICENSE` only.

## Implementation sequencing (agreed order)

1. **Level Definition loader + generator**  — `SPEC-LEVEL.md`  ← current
2. Player + carry system
3. Pathfinding infrastructure
4. Enemies + spawners
5. Abilities
6. Meta systems
7. Rendering / lighting

Later subsystems leave **seams** in earlier ones (SPEC-LEVEL §6): nav-blocker
registry (#3), plate-press / key-spend setters (#2), spawner tick (#4),
light-emitter registry (#7), music registry. Fill seams, don't reach across.

## Documentation index (authoritative sources)

- `GDD.md` — design intent (v1.1, complete).
- `CLAUDE.md` — conventions + non-negotiables (loaded every session).
- `SPEC-LEVEL.md` — level loader+generator implementation spec (final, signed off).
- `STATUS.md` — this file.
- `add2026` repo — **external, read-only** reference only (GDD §13); never a
  Repossessed source of truth, never committed to.

## Decision log (append-only)

### 2026-07-05 — SPEC-LEVEL signed off (D1–D3, Q3)
- **D1 — grid field is `tiles`** (array of row-major strings), not `grid`.
  Matches ADD's loader/validator/world primitives. (SPEC-LEVEL §1)
- **D2 — `generateLevel(n, rng)` takes an injected rng.** Content
  (roster / spawn budget / ramp) is a **pure function of `n`**; geometry and
  placement consume the rng — **fresh** seed in production (layout varies per
  visit), **fixed** seed in tests. **No seed is persisted** in saves; resume
  rebuilds a fresh layout with the same n-derived content. (SPEC-LEVEL §1, §5; GDD §12.3)
- **D3 — doors/plates are one model.** Grid char (`d` plate-door, `_` plate,
  `D` locked) places the cell; a `placement` assigns its `id`; `links` wire
  plate→door. Locked `D` doors are pure tiles (key-driven, no id/link).
  (SPEC-LEVEL §1, §3)
- **Q3 — "no two consecutive dark Nights"** tracked via one **unsaved** boolean
  `G._prevDark` (starts `false` on resume; harmless). (SPEC-LEVEL §9)
- **Convention — recommended code split:** implement subsystem #1 as
  `level-loader.js` + `level-generator.js` (SPEC-LEVEL §7), per split-on-seams
  file discipline.

## Architecture / circular-import decisions

*(none yet — record here when they arise, per CLAUDE.md. Expected for #1:
`level` ↔ `nav` and `level` ↔ entity factories, both resolved via
register-callbacks / one-way flow — see SPEC-LEVEL §7.)*

## Known open items (non-blocking for build)

Tuning / design-feel only — none block implementing the mechanism:
Q1 archetype algorithm play-feel; Q2 key budget (GDD §14.1); Q4 fallback
archetype identity; Q5 the `(proposed)` generator numbers (GDD §14.2).
