# STATUS — Repossessed

**Last updated:** 2026-07-05 (Phase 3 — level-loader.js)
**State in one line:** Foundation (config/state/world) + the level **loader**
are built and tested; the level **generator** is the remaining half of
subsystem #1. Everything a later subsystem owns is stubbed behind a
register-callbacks seam (nav / entity factories / events).

## How to use this file

Claude Code reads this **first**, every session, before touching code. At the
**end** of every session, update *Build status* and append to the *Decision log*
and *Architecture decisions* sections. This is the cross-session memory — keep it
current or the next session starts blind.

## Build status (mirrors GDD build-status index — all NOT BUILT)

- [~] **§8 Level** — **loader DONE** (schema/validate/loadLevel/tile-state+links/spawn-rule placement); tile set, dark lighting done as stamps; **generator PENDING** ← **NEXT**
- [ ] §2 Player — movement, health/overheal, melee, ranged, carry/vault states
- [ ] §7 Interactive objects — crates, barrels, shrapnel, carry physics
- [ ] §6.4 Pathfinding — grid A\*, per-class masks, nav-dirtying
- [ ] §6 Enemies + spawners
- [ ] §5 Abilities — Nova, Lightning, gem economy
- [ ] §3 Power-ups & pickups
- [ ] §12 Meta — menu, pause, options, 5-slot save/load, achievements, high score
- [ ] §9/§10/§11 Scoring, HUD, render/lighting, audio

Repo `src/` contains: `config.js`, `state.js`, `world.js`, `level-loader.js`.
Tests: `test-config.js`, `test-world.js`, `test-level-loader.js` (all green).
Generator (`level-generator.js`) not yet built.

## Implementation sequencing (agreed order)

1. **Level Definition loader + generator**  — `SPEC-LEVEL.md`  ← current
2. Player + carry system
3. Pathfinding infrastructure
4. Enemies + spawners
5. Abilities
6. Meta systems
7. Rendering / lighting

Later subsystems leave **seams** in earlier ones (SPEC-LEVEL §6): nav-blocker
registry (#3), plate-press / key-spend setters (#2), spawner tick (#4),
light-emitter registry (#7), music registry. Fill seams, don't reach across.

## Documentation index (authoritative sources)

- `GDD.md` — design intent (v1.1, complete).
- `CLAUDE.md` — conventions + non-negotiables (loaded every session).
- `SPEC-LEVEL.md` — level loader+generator implementation spec (final, signed off).
- `STATUS.md` — this file.
- `add2026` repo — **external, read-only** reference only (GDD §13); never a
  Repossessed source of truth, never committed to.

## Decision log (append-only)

### 2026-07-05 — SPEC-LEVEL signed off (D1–D3, Q3)
- **D1 — grid field is `tiles`** (array of row-major strings), not `grid`.
  Matches ADD's loader/validator/world primitives. (SPEC-LEVEL §1)
- **D2 — `generateLevel(n, rng)` takes an injected rng.** Content
  (roster / spawn budget / ramp) is a **pure function of `n`**; geometry and
  placement consume the rng — **fresh** seed in production (layout varies per
  visit), **fixed** seed in tests. **No seed is persisted** in saves; resume
  rebuilds a fresh layout with the same n-derived content. (SPEC-LEVEL §1, §5; GDD §12.3)
- **D3 — doors/plates are one model.** Grid char (`d` plate-door, `_` plate,
  `D` locked) places the cell; a `placement` assigns its `id`; `links` wire
  plate→door. Locked `D` doors are pure tiles (key-driven, no id/link).
  (SPEC-LEVEL §1, §3)
- **Q3 — "no two consecutive dark Nights"** tracked via one **unsaved** boolean
  `G._prevDark` (starts `false` on resume; harmless). (SPEC-LEVEL §9)
- **Convention — recommended code split:** implement subsystem #1 as
  `level-loader.js` + `level-generator.js` (SPEC-LEVEL §7), per split-on-seams
  file discipline.

## Architecture / circular-import decisions

### 2026-07-05 — `world` ↔ `level-loader` (register-callbacks)
`world.js` exposes `registerTileStateResolver(fn)`. `level-loader.js` (Phase 3)
will register itself as the resolver at load time; `world.js` never imports
`level-loader.js`. `isWall`/`blocksLOS` consult the resolver first for every
cell (not just `d`/`D`) and fall back to the static `CFG.TILES` flag when no
resolver is registered or the resolver returns a falsy state — this is the
correct behavior since the resolver stub only ever returns a truthy state for
actual door cells. Matches SPEC-LEVEL §7's flagged risk, resolved as
prescribed.

### 2026-07-05 — `level-loader` ↔ `nav` (register-callbacks) — Phase 3
Resolved as flagged (SPEC-LEVEL §6.1/§7). `level-loader.js` exposes
`registerBlockerSink(sink)` and `markNavDirty(tile)`; the default sink is a
no-op object `{registerBlocker(){}, markDirty(){}}`. The loader registers each
movable entity (crate/barrel/spawner) as a blocker **at placement time**
(§4.5 — folds the spec's step-7 pass in) and calls `markNavDirty` on every door
open/close (recomputeDoor + openLockedDoor). `level-loader.js` never imports
nav; nav registers itself as the sink at boot.

### 2026-07-05 — `level-loader` ↔ entity factories (registry + placeholders) — Phase 3
Resolved as flagged (SPEC-LEVEL §6.2/§6.3/§7). `registerEntityFactory(type,fn)`;
the loader ships **placeholder** factories now (minimal inert
`{type,x,y,tc,blocks}`; the `spawner` placeholder also carries `variant`, its
`eligible(G.night)`-filtered enemy table, and ramped `interval`/`liveCap`).
`level-loader.js` does **not** import `player.js`/`enemies.js` (they don't exist
yet — a forward/circular hazard). **Owed by #2/#4:** real player/enemy/spawner
factories that override the placeholders via `registerEntityFactory`. `player`
and `exit` are handled inline (singletons on `G`), not via the registry.

### 2026-07-05 — event emit routed through a seam (events.js not built) — Phase 3
`loadLevel` step 9 emits `level:start`, but `events.js` is a later subsystem and
importing it would break the config/state/world-only rule. Resolved with a
register-callbacks seam: `registerEmit(fn)`, default no-op; the payload is a
snapshot (one-way flow). **Owed:** `events.js` registers its `emit` when it
lands. Keeps loader imports = config/state/world only (acceptance).

### 2026-07-05 — RAMP snapshot hoisted before placements — Phase 3
SPEC-LEVEL §4.1 numbers the `CFG.RAMP`→`G.ramp` snapshot as step 8 (after
placements), but §6.3 requires spawner entities — created during placements
(steps 5–6) — to read ramped `interval`/`liveCap` from `G.ramp`. Resolved by
computing the snapshot immediately after the transient-clear (step 4), before
placements. Still read **exactly once at load, never mid-level** (§8.6 upheld);
only the intra-load ordering moved. Flagged here per "phases flag their own
risks" — the spec's step numbering and §6.3 were in tension.

*(Still expected later: real nav grid + entity modules fill the seams above.)*

## Known open items (non-blocking for build)

Tuning / design-feel only — none block implementing the mechanism:
Q1 archetype algorithm play-feel; Q2 key budget (GDD §14.1); Q4 fallback
archetype identity; Q5 the `(proposed)` generator numbers (GDD §14.2).

## Session log

### 2026-07-05 — Phase 1 (config/state foundation)

Phase 1 — config/state/package.json authored; CFG.{TILES,PLAN,RAMP,SPAWNER,GEN}
in place; G run-state + G.ramp slot + G._prevDark added. `node test-config.js`
green (11 checks). `config.js`/`state.js` import nothing (leaf modules,
confirmed structurally by the test). No behavior/build-status box flipped —
data only.

**Spec gap found (not invented around):** SPEC-LEVEL §5.1's `CFG.PLAN.costs`
table omits `lobber`, despite `lobber` being introduced as a roster element on
Night 4 (§5.1 `introductions`). Filled in using the same documented formula
the rest of the table follows (GDD §6.2 pts ÷ 50): Lobber = 100 pts → cost 2
(matches Skeleton's cost, which also has 100 pts). Comment left in
`config.js` at the `costs` table. Flagging here per CLAUDE.md's "surface,
don't invent design" rule — this is a mechanical fill via an existing
formula, not a new tuning decision, but worth a sign-off glance.

### 2026-07-05 — Phase 2 (`world.js` — tile-grid primitives)

Ported from add2026 `src/world.js`: `loadTileGrid`, `isWall`, `blocksLOS`,
`tileCenter`, `randomFloorTileTC`, `randomFloorTile`, `tileFloor`,
`bodyHitsWall`, `hasLineOfSight`. Added `registerTileStateResolver` seam
(§3.2) — see *Architecture / circular-import decisions* above. Deleted (not
stubbed): `bakeConveyors`, `isDestructible`, `destroyShelf`, `pushField`/
`pushAt`/`pushAtWorld`/`applyBeltPush`/`clampNet` (all conveyor-only), and the
Cleaner-patrol-only helpers not required by this phase's spec list
(`tileClearRun`, `rectPerimeterClear`, `isBorderTile`, `moveBody`, `clamp`) —
none were named in SPEC-LEVEL §3.1's reuse list; add back if a later phase's
spec calls for them. `node test-world.js` green (28 checks), `node
test-config.js` still green (11 checks). No import of `level-loader.js` from
`world.js` (grep-verified).

**Spec gap found (not invented around):** `CFG.TILE` (tile pixel size) was
missing from Phase 1's `config.js` — every geometry helper ported in this
phase (`bodyHitsWall`, `tileCenter`, `hasLineOfSight`, `randomFloorTile`)
needs it. Not specified in SPEC-LEVEL or GDD excerpts read this session.
Ported verbatim from add2026 `CFG.TILE: 32` (a fixed pixel constant, not a
design decision) into `config.js`, commented at the point of addition.
Flagging per CLAUDE.md's "surface, don't invent design" rule — this is a
mechanical port of an existing constant, not new tuning, but worth a
sign-off glance in case Repossessed wants a different tile size.

Code map: `src/world.js` now exists.

### 2026-07-05 — Phase 3 (`level-loader.js` — the loader)

Built `src/level-loader.js` (19KB, one concern; under the 24KB smell) +
`test-level-loader.js` (34 checks green, stable across repeated runs since it
exercises `Math.random` scatter). Ported + extended from add2026 `src/level.js`
(`loadLevel`/`validateLevelDef`/`pickTile`/`runSpawnRule`/`zonesWithRole`).

Implements: Level Def v2 `validateLevelDef` (full §4.3 incl. ★links-ref-ids,
★door/plate-on-matching-char [D3], ★avoid-role, ★spawner-variant-in-CFG,
★script-actor no-op seam); the ordered `loadLevel` (§4.1) — validate → parse
grid (no conveyor bake) → build tile-state+link graph (recompute once) → clear
transient/preserve run-state → **ramp snapshot (hoisted, see Arch decisions)** →
placements player-FIRST/exit/rest → spawn rules → emit; the mutable tile-state
store `Map<ty*COLS+tx, DoorState|PlateState>` with `setPlatePressed`/
`openLockedDoor`/`recomputeDoor` (pure, open-iff-any-linked-plate-pressed);
extended spawn-rule placement (400-try + guaranteed-floor fallback, ★never on
plate/exit, ★new types, movable→blocker). Registered the world.js
tile-state resolver (returns door states only — plates fall through to the
static non-solid flag). Ramp evaluation (§5.5 `clampToward`/tier) lives here
because `loadLevel` owns the snapshot; the generator can reuse it.

Tests cover SPEC-LEVEL §8 items **4** (scatter never on solid/plate/exit),
**5** (11 validation rejects), **6** (link graph: press opens / release closes /
two-plate either-opens, read black-box via `world.isWall` on the door tile),
**8** (transient arrays cleared, run-state hp/keys/gems/score/night preserved),
plus an import-discipline grep (config/state/world only).

**No spec gaps requiring invented design.** Two spec-internal tensions were
*resolved procedurally* (not design decisions) and logged under Architecture:
the RAMP step-8-vs-§6.3 ordering, and the `events.js`-not-built emit path.
Owed by later phases: real entity factories (#2/#4), nav sink (#3), events.js
`emit` registration. Generator (`level-generator.js`) is the next build.
